## OVS container
Ovs container is a container with ovs capabilities. Once a container is created
from this image (with host_network=True), ovs capabilities will be plugged
into the container.

### Building
to build simply run
```bash
make
```
This will create output directly `image` which is an ubuntu root with openvswitch installed.
It also will have the required `.startup.toml` and `.plugin.toml`

Once the `image` is created you cat upload it to `hub.gig.tech`
